# Prompting_Tool

This project aims to create a developer tool to facilitate prompt engineering.

## Overview

### Problem Statement

When building GenAI applications having a good prompt that solves the task at hand, is one of the first task of the project.

But how does a good prompt look like, if:
- Prompts can be written following several techniques, each with a unique impact on outputs.
- Prompts won't generate the same results on different models.
- Prompts need to follow a manual and iterative process to be optimized.

Wouldn't it be nice to have a tool that can optimize my initial prompt and show the prompt optimized for different techniques as well?

After all, the art of prompting is the art of following patterns and styles to get the most out of a model.
